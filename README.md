ChlorophyllDipoleCoupling2024
a simple code for computing coupling (energy in 1/cm) between chlorophylls in the point-dipole approximation; takes pdb file as input. 
which is converted by running a script ....m into a set of dipole coordinates based no the position of Chl nitrogen atoms, this is saved into a text file.
This can be used as an input for the script ....m which computes and visualizes the coupling energies between pigment pairs in the structure.
