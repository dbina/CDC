ChlorophyllDipoleCoupling2024
a simple code for computing coupling (energy in 1/cm) between chlorophylls in the point-dipole approximation; takes pdb file as input. 
This is converted to a set of dipole coordinates using the position of Chl nitrogen atoms using the script ....m 
This can be used as an input for the script ....m which computes and visualizes the coupling energies between pigment pairs in the structure
