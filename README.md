ChlorophyllDipoleCoupling
a simple code for computing coupling (energy in 1/cm) between chlorophylls in the point-dipole approximation; takes pdb file as input, 
which is converted by running a script pdb2mre_chl.m into a set of dipole coordinates based on the position of Chl nitrogen atoms, this is saved into a text file.
Dipoles can be used as an input for the script plot_couplings.m which computes and visualizes the coupling energies between pigment pairs in the structure.
